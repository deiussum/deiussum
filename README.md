ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @deiussum

I've been developing software since the late 90s.  My Github space is mostly a bunch of private repos for side projects I've done over the years.  I've got a couple I made public and will likely open up more of them at some point when I get the time to look back at them to see if they even still work. :)  Nothing too exciting here.

Testing to see if GitHub displays Mermaid diagrams.
